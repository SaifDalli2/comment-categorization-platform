## Deploy to Heroku

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Enhanced gateway with production-ready sync monitoring"

# Deploy to Heroku
git push heroku main

# Check deployment
heroku logs --tail --app=gateway-service-b25f91548194
```

## Test After Deployment

```bash
# Test basic health
curl https://gateway-service-b25f91548194.herokuapp.com/health

# Test sync status
curl https://gateway-service-b25f91548194.herokuapp.com/health/sync

# Test service dependencies
curl https://gateway-service-b25f91548194.herokuapp.com/health/services

# Run sync check script
npm run sync:check
```

## New Features Available

1. **Enhanced Health Monitoring**
   - `/health` - Basic gateway health
   - `/health/services` - Service dependency status
   - `/health/sync` - Service synchronization status

2. **Better Request Handling**
   - Request correlation IDs
   - Enhanced error messages
   - Improved rate limiting

3. **Production Sync Monitoring**
   - Automatic service health tracking
   - Sync status reporting
   - Production-ready monitoring

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check heroku logs: `heroku logs --app=gateway-service-b25f91548194`
2. Verify all required files exist
3. Check that service URLs are correct in config/simple.js

If services show as unhealthy:
1. Verify service URLs are correct
2. Deploy missing services
3. Check service health endpoints individually
